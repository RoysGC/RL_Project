# Reinforcement Learning Project
### Description
This project explores various reinforcement learning techniques in solving complex environments. Initially, we examine tabular solutions like the Na√Øve Policy and the Monte Carlo method applied to a blackjack environment, highlighting their simplicity and inherent limitations. The project then delves into approximate solutions, notably the REINFORCE algorithm in the Lunar Lander environment, demonstrating the agent's learning progression and policy refinement. Finally, we tackle the Gymnasium's Assault Environment, employing advanced methods like DQN, DDQN, Dueling-DQN, and Actor-Critic models. These methods' efficacy is evaluated in terms of their learning stability and performance in a dynamic, high-dimensional space.

### Dependencies
To install and run this project, the following extra libraries are required (doing pip install):

1. imageio
2. gym[accept-rom-license]
3. ale-py
4. swig
5. box2d-py

### Installation
To install the project, simply clone the repository and execute it. Once the repository is cloned and set up, running the project should not pose any problems. Ensure all dependencies are installed as mentioned above. We have also add the requirements.txt in the repository.

### Usage
The project is structured into three main folders, each corresponding to a different part of the project. Inside the 'Assault' folder, there are five additional folders, each for a different implemented model, and another for various gifs as results of the models. In the other two folder there are the notebooks of the respective part and in LunarLander folder there is also a folder of a unique gif as result of the test of the trained model.
